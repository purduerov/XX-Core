This is the folder subset for everything that (hopefully) happens above the surface.

NOTE: Babel requires a preset specifying that it's helping compile a react file in either a .bablerc file or within the webpack.config.js file itself. I (Ian) have a .babelrc file on my laptop it seems, but it missed translation to GitHub, and now it's specified within the webpack.config.js file just to be safe. Ubuntu now successfully builds the React components again.
