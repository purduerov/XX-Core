This is the telemitry/the super-imposed orientation display for the driver over/next to the camera viewing port.
Doesn't have to be super complex, but it needs to be comprehensible at a glance ideally.

packet: {
		[current accelaratoin:] {x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw},
		[current orientation:]  {roll, pitch, yaw}
	}

Make this more descriptive as it's developed (i.e. functionality, use, possibly known bugs, pending improvements, etc.)
