This is the webpage attachement for the file-saving/user preferences module. This will need to be just the interface for the electron changes that will actually enable the file access, saving, name reading, etc.

The graphics of this component should be streamlined all the same, and display the information in a meaningful and comprehensive manner.

Make this more descriptive as it's developed (i.e. functionality, use, possibly known bugs, pending improvements, etc.)
